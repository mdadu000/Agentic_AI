Follow the steps below to set up and run the backend application.

## 🚀 Steps to Start the Backend App

1. **Navigate to the backend directory**  
   ```bash
   cd /workspace/easy_dine_agent/backend
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**  
   Before running the application, install all necessary Python packages using:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Create Google AI Studio Key**
   Visit https://aistudio.google.com/ using your personal gmail id and create an API Key. If you are a first time user you might have to create a new project in https://console.cloud.google.com/ first , import it here and then create API Key.

4. **Update env with Google AI Studio Key**
   Once the key is created copy the key value and update the below variable in .env file
   GOOGLE_API_KEY="Use your key"
   ```

5. **Run the backend server**  
   Once the dependencies are installed, start the application with:  
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

## 🚀 Steps to Start the Frontend App

1. Find the `index.html` file inside the **frontend** directory.

2. **Configure the backend connection**  
   - Ensure that the **backend server** is up and running.  
   - Open the `apiService.js` file (usually located inside the `js` or `services` folder).  
   - Get the host URL or API base URL from the Endpoints (Plug Icon) in the leftside panel and look for 8080 Port.
     Example:  
     ```js
     const API_CONFIG = {
         baseURL: "Replace with url from your workspace", // Configure the relavant backend url
         headers: {
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
         },
     };
     ```

3. **Start the frontend app**  
   - Right-click on `index.html`.  
   - Choose **"Open with Live Server"** (available in VS Code or similar editors).  
   - The application will automatically open in your default web browser.
